        <h3>
            The GaysNet team is made up of three of the straightest males you will ever come across, who, 
            social pressures and handicaps notwithstanding, strive to realise their dreams for a better Perth and, 
            by extension, the whole of Western Australia by continually seeking to improve the public transportation
            network through hard work and derailed planning. We are all qualified urban planning specialists who use 
            our hard-earned skills for the good of society.
