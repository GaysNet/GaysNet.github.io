        <h1>Seaforth Station Upgrade</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="projectDescription">
        <h2>GaysNet will propose a 276 million dollar plan that will involve the upgrading of Seaforth station:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>14 bus stands, including being served by the CircleRoute. All routes terminating at Kelmscott will now instead terminate here. 12 of these stands are set-down only, the 13th is rail replacement, and the 14th is every single other route.</li>
            <li>1500 parking spaces in a multi-storey car park. Out of those, only one is an ACROD space, and it is the third-furthest spot from the actual station.</li>
            <li>Passenger amenities including toilets, kiosk and ticketing.</li>
            <li>Not wheelchair accessible because there will only be one set of stairs as an entrance to the station which can only access Platform 2 and not Platform 1. Trains will only stop at Platform 1 and not at Platform 2.</li>
            <li>Ignore what I said because Platform 2 is being renumbered to Platform 9 and 3/4.</li>
            <li>5-zone fare to Perth because fuck the fare cap teehee</li>
            <li>Level crossings will not be removed.</li>
            <li>New S pattern to replace C Pattern in peak: express from McIver to Seaforth. Only inbound S pattern trains will stop at Perth Stadium on stadium days.</li>
            <li>A massive fucking Walmart bag will be a statue blocking the Platform 1 entrance (this is why you cannot access it).</li>
            <li>For every dollar you donate to the project, we will cut down a tree.</li>
            <li>One bicycle space where locks are not allowed.</li>
            <li>No transit guards. They will be guarding Challis instead.</li>
            <li>New high frequency route 944 from Seaforth to Success Hill express. Possible deviation K via Caves Road.</li>
            <li>Addition of a helipad.</li>
            <li>All signs, posters and warnings will be replaced with emojis.</li>
        </ul>
